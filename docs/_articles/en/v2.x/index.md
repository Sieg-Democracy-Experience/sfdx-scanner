## Salesforce Code Analyzer

Salesforce Code Analyzer (Code Analyzer) is a unified tool for source code analysis. Code Analyzer analyzes multiple languages. It relies on a consistent command-line interface and produces a results file of rule violations. Use the results to review and improve your code.

Code Analyzer currently supports the [PMD rule engine](https://pmd.github.io/), [PMD Copy Paste Detector](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [RetireJS](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/).
Version 3.x also includes Salesforce Graph Engine.

Integrate Code Analyzer into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) process to enforce rules that you define and to produce high-quality code.
