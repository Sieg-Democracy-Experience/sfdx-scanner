## Installing version v3.x
By default, latest tag gets installed and as of today, it still points to {{ site.data.versions.scanner }}.

To specifically install the latest {{ site.data.versions-v3.scanner }} version:

1. Uninstall existing Salesforce Code Analyzer plugin: 
```
sfdx plugins:uninstall @salesforce/sfdx-scanner
```
2. Install the pilot tag of the same plugin: 
```
sfdx plugins:install @salesforce/sfdx-scanner@latest-pilot
```
3. Verify correct version was installed: sfdx plugins
    a. @salesforce/sfdx-scanner should point to {{ site.data.versions-v3.scanner }}
