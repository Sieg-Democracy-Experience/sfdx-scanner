## Whatâ€™s new in v3.x?

As a starting point, we have upgraded major versions of the eslint family of engines:
1. eslint from major version 6 to major version 8
2. typescript-eslint plugin from major version 2 to major version 5
3. eslint-lwc plugin from major version 0 to major version 1

Another change is that RetireJS will be included as a default engine along with PMD, Eslint, and Eslint-Typescript.

Some deprecated flags have been removed:
1. `-v/--violations-cause-error` flag on `scanner:run` has been replaced by `-s/--severity-threshold`. 

There are other exciting changes in the works that will be released as a part of minor releases. Watch out this space for more information!
