This is an example of what a custom ruleset file should look like.
The `name` property of the `ruleset` tag indicates the value that can be supplied to
scanner:run's -r flag.
Note that since this ruleset uses Apex rules, its location is `rulesets/apex`.

	<!--
	Custom rulesets should not define any rules themselves.
	Instead, as seen here, they should consist of `rule` tags whose `ref` property is the path
	to a rule defined in a category.
	As this example demonstrates, custom rulesets can reference both PMD's built-in rules and
	your own custom rules.
	In this way, you can use custom rulesets to run rules from multiple categories at the same time.
