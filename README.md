# Salesforce Code Analyzer Plug-in
Salesforce Code Analyzer (Code Analyzer) is a unified tool for source code analysis. Code Analyzer analyzes multiple languages. It relies on a consistent command-line interface and produces a results file of rule violations. Use the results to review and improve your code.

Code Analyzer currently supports the [PMD rule engine](https://pmd.github.io/), [PMD Copy Paste Detector](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [RetireJS](https://retirejs.github.io/retire.js/).
Version 3.x also includes Salesforce Graph Engine.

Integrate Code Analyzer into your Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) process to enforce rules that you define and to produce high-quality code.

# Official Documentation
All the official Code Analyzer documentation is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://forcedotcom.github.io/sfdx-scanner/). These documents include instructions on how to install Code Analyzer, the command reference, writing and managing custom rules and an overview of the architecture of Code Analyzer.
